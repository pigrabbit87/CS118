1. VU#912420 (2013-04-30) IBM Notes runs arbitrary JAVA and Javascript in emails
Everyone has at least one email account these days. if the attacker is able to
send an email with the malicious code and have the client load Java applets
without realizing, , the impact will be devastating. 

2. VU#945216 (2001-10-24) SSH CRC32 attack detection code contains remote
integer overflow SSH is widely used for encrypted remote access control all over
the world, things like file transferring. If an attacker is able to take
advantage of the "secured" server and exploit the application or web server, the
remotely accessed site will be corrupted.

3. VU#237655 (2013-05-06) Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 CGenericElement object
use-after-free vulnerability I ranked this lower than the previous two because
there are other version of IE and the probability of accessing the malicious
website is not as high as the other two. However, it is still on the scope of
the internet, meaning that once there's damage it will impact more than the
local site. 

4. VU#127108 (2013-05-14) Serva32 2.1.0 TFTPD service buffer overflow
vulnerability The impact of this vulnerability only occurs on the users of the
application only. It is not as widely used as the previous three. Even though
there is no solution available right now, the users can try to lower the attack
by restricting access to only trusting host. 

5. VU#774103 (2013-05-17) Linux kernel perf_swevent_enabled array out-of-bound
access privilege escalation vulnerability This vulnerability makes it possible
for the unprivileged users to have higher privileged. However, this happens
locally. The damage depends on how much access the unprivileged users can get.
