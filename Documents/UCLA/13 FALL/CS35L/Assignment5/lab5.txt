#we found that the qsort function is using func as a comparison to sort the

#have noticed that I can't set breakpoints for the cmp_mtime function so I use
#printf for diff to see what the comparison is returning. It turns out that
#timespec_cmp returns b's time - a's time. when the difference is positive,
#the order needs to be reverse. when the difference is negative, the order
#stays unchanged. The bug is that when there is negative timestamps, the
#functions doesn're return the correct differences between the two. So I
#decided to write another cmp_mtime function.
