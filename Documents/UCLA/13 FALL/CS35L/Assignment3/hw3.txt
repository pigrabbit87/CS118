Q1: the purpose of this line is as a goto line for the code inside the for loop
in line 2030. Since the code is changed after the patch, the line is no longer
necessary but it's not necessary to delete it either because it's never used
after the patch.  Q2: since each region has its own way of displaying time, the
patch might case confusion for some of the users Q3: Traceback (most recent call
last): File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module> main() File "./randline.py",
line 64, in main sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline()) File "./randline.py",
line 34, in chooseline return random.choice(self.lines) File
"/usr/lib64/python2.6/random.py", line 261, in choice return
seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

the reason is that it is trying to pass a null argument to the chooseline
methodand it will cause a problem because there is nothing inside the file.

Q4: there is syntax error File "randline.py", line 65 except IOError as (errno,
strerror): ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax

in python 3 the syntax should be except IOError as xxx_todo_changeme: (errno,
strerror) = xxx_todo_changeme.args parser.error("I/O error({0}): {1}".
format(errno, strerror))
